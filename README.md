# Description

We provide movies and TV information by [TMDB](https://www.themoviedb.org/?language=en). You can use
this app to know movies' overview or TV overview, see action stills and actors & actresses picture.

This application is based on an architecture called __*MVP*__ architecture. Actually we don't only
practice developing an application simply, but also create a base MVP architecture for other
projects, too.

This is the first time for us to mix two languages in this project, one is __Kotlin__, the other one
is __Java__, we could know which parts that Kotlin is stronger and more convenient than Java.

### MVP architecture

We referenced the
[Google clean architecture](https://github.com/googlesamples/android-architecture/tree/todo-mvp-clean/)
to this application. There're three parts of clean architecture as below.

1. __Presentation Layer__
2. __Domain Layer__
3. __Data Layer__.

### programming language

__*Kotlin*__ in __Presentation Layer__. <br> __*Java*__ in __Domain Layer__ and __Data Layer__.

# Third-party library

We're using a lot of Rx family libraries.

1. [RxKotlin](https://github.com/ReactiveX/RxKotlin)
2. [RxBinding](https://github.com/JakeWharton/RxBinding)
3. [RxBus](https://github.com/AndroidKnife/RxBus)
4. [RxLifecycle](https://github.com/trello/RxLifecycle)
5. [KotterKnife](https://github.com/JakeWharton/kotterknife)
6. [Retrofit2](https://github.com/square/retrofit)
7. [Glide](https://github.com/bumptech/glide)
8. [Dagger 2](https://github.com/google/dagger)


# TODO & FEATURE WORK

### architecture

Our architecture may not enough convenient for start-up project. If you have any good idea, please
tell us.

- [x] Decouple between UseCases.
- [x] Decouple the injection of library component.


### App

- [x] Checking movie and TV trailers.
